# HI THERE, I AM TAKI AHMED (AKA abobymotaki)

**OBJECTIVE:** Frontend Developer.
### ABOUT ME
Full-stack developer and software engineering student with a knack for turning chaotic thoughts into clean, working code. Whether I’m freelancing solo or collaborating in a team, I thrive on building useful things out of nothing. Quick to learn, always refining, and endlessly experimenting with tools like Vue.js, Laravel, Java, and PHP. I don’t just live to code—I code to make sense of things.
